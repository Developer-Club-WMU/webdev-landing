                                Hello Everyone,
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                                I'm excited to announce the launch of a brand new student organization at Western Michigan University ‚Äî <span className="text-white font-semibold">Developer Club</span> ‚Äî a community for computer science students who want to bridge the gap between academia and the tech industry.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                                One of the biggest challenges for students in tech is that college often focuses heavily on theory‚Äîcovering algorithms and concepts‚Äîwithout offering enough real-world, hands-on experience. This gap makes it tough to land jobs that require practical skills like building full-stack apps, deploying machine learning models, or collaborating with teams using industry tools.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                                <span className="text-white font-semibold">Developer Club‚Äôs mission</span> is to bridge that gap by giving students the opportunity to work on real projects, join specialized tech departments (like web, AI/ML, game dev, automation, and more), and gain experience that actually prepares them for the tech industry.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                                <strong>Come join us for our first ever Info Night! KVCC Students are welcome!</strong><br />
                                <span className="text-yellow-300">üìÖ Monday, April 14th<br />üïï 6PM ‚Äì 8PM<br />üìç WMU College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Room D115 and D109</span>

                            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                                This will be a casual kickoff event where you can learn what the club is all about, meet the team, and sign up for the departments that interest you most. You‚Äôll also get a sneak peek at the Developer Challenge, a year-long project initiative that each team will work on throughout the year.
                            </p>

                                We‚Äôll also be doing a fun icebreaker bingo activity to help you connect with other students and get to know potential teammates across different departments.
